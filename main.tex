				There is no restriction on the total number of chapters in a project report/ thesis. The number of chapters differs according to the field of study conducted by the candidate whether it is science-based or social-science-based. However, the content of the chapters may differ according to the candidate's research or conventions of individual School/ Faculty.
				
				The body of the Project Report/ Thesis must be written in paragraphs. There must be continuity or logical flow among paragraphs. Long paragraphs are advised to be avoided.
				
				Generally, a basic structure for the project report/ thesis is as below:
				
				•	Introduction
				
				•	Literature Review
				
				•	Research Methodology
				
				•	Results
				
				•	Discussion
				
				•	Conclusion and Recommendation
				
				•	References
				
				The level of English writing must be appropriate to the level of the Bachelor’s degree. Attention should be paid to correct spelling, grammar, punctuation, sentence structure and clarity of style.
				
				Normally, no first person references (e.g. I, we, us) shall appear in the report. If self-reference is required, reference may be made to “the author” or “this study”. Exceptions are acceptable in the conclusion section, where personal comments may be appropriate.

		\chapter{\textbf{LITERATURE REVIEW}}{
			\begin{flushleft}
				\section{Background}{
					A literature review is a description of the literature relevant to a particular field or topic of study. It consists of a critically written and comprehensive account of the published works on a topic by accredited scholars and researchers. A critical literature review is a critical assessment of the relevant literature. It is directly related to the research, providing information on theories, models, materials and techniques used in the research. The literature review should be comprehensive and include recent publications which are relevant to the research.
					
					The literature review should not be just a compilation or reproduction of the works of others. It requires the student to examine and comment critically on the literature relevant to the student’s area of research. Students should be aware of that getting hold of the right material is only a small part of the research process, but being able to put ideas, information, data and arguments together in an integrated and coherent manner makes the difference between success and failure.
					
					The literature review should clearly indicate what diversity of views exist among the authors in this area of study, and the student should show how and where his/her research fits in.
				}
				\section{Submission}{
					The minimum word limit for the Project Report/ Thesis, excluding tables and figures, and references is 10,000 words and must not exceed 30,000 words. However, the word limit may differ in each individual school/ faculty, academy, institute or center with its own additional requirements.
				}
				
				\section{Table Formatting}{
					% put your table here
					The tables should be arranged according to the chapters. The numbering system is according to the chapter, for e.g.: tables in Chapter 1 are numbered sequentially: Table 1.1, Table 1.2 and so on.
					
					\begin{table}[t]
						\caption{Technical Specification of Force Sensing Resistor}

						\label{tab:my_label}
					\end{table}
				}
				
				\section{Figure Formatting}{
					% put your figure here 
					Figures include diagrams, photographs, drawings, graphs, charts and maps. The figures should be arranged according to the chapters. For example, figures in Chapter 1 are numbered sequentially: Figure 1.1, Figure 1.2 and so on.
